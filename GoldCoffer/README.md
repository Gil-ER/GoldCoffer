# GoldCoffer
Track WoW gold across your account.

# What it Does:
As you log into your characters this addon saves the gold they poses. When you gain or loose gold the total will be updated. 

You can mouse over the minimap button to get some totals and help information.

 

There are 6 tabs across the bottom of the GoldCoffer window. 

## Gold Report:
The left side of this tab lists the servers you have characters on and the amount of total gold on the server. Checking a box on the left side will give you a detailed list of each character on that server and the gold that they have.

 

## Gold Summery:
List the gold you had on the account at various times over the past

 

## Daily History:
Lists the last 50 days you were in game in 3 columns listing the date, your total gold and the change over the previous day.

 

## Weekly History:
Lists the last 50 Weeks you were in game in 3 columns listing the date, your total gold and the change over the previous day. The week begins on the weekly reset date (I think this is correct for any region).

 

## Yearly History:
Lists the last few years (if you had this addon recording the data) again like above listing date, gold and gain/loss.

 

## Currencies:   *NEW*
The left side lists the currencies, subdivided and grouped like they are on the currency tab in game. Clicking on a currency will give you a list on the right side of all characters with that currency and the amount they have.

 

 

Tracking can only be done on a single account. If you have more than one account there isn't an easy way to combine the data.
