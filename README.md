# GoldCoffer
Track WoW gold across your account.

# What it Does:
As you log into your characters this addon saves the gold they posess. When you gain or loose gold the total will be updated. You can mouse over the minimap button to get some totals and help information. Opening the GoldCoffer window will present you with your total gold your profit loss for the day, from the previous day and the week. You are also given checkboxes for each realm you have characters on. Selecting a checkbox opens an expanded list of the server showing tthe gold each character has.

It will only track the gold you have on a single account.
